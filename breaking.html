    <p>The king of Ithaca, Odysseus, has been missing for decades. Where could he have been?</p>

    <p>After twenty long years, the King of Ithaca has returned. We at The Ancient Greece Times were fortunate enough to sit down with the legendary hero himself, Odysseus, to learn where he has been all this time and what perils he faced on his long voyage home.</p>

    <p>Reporter: Welcome home, King Odysseus! Everyone has been wondering—what was the most dangerous part of your adventure?</p>

    <p>Odysseus: Every part of my trip was dangerous! But I think the scariest time was when I faced the Cyclops, a giant with one eye who wanted to eat me and my men. I had to use my brain to trick him so we could escape. Poseidon, the sea god, also made things hard for me with huge storms.</p>

    <p>Reporter: Twenty years is a long time to be away from home. How do you feel now that you’ve finally returned to Ithaca?</p>

    <p>Odysseus: I am so happy to see my wife, Penelope, and my son, Telemachus, again. I missed them every single day. Still, I feel sad too, because not all of my friends made it home with me.</p>

    <p>Reporter: You’ve become a legend across the world. What lesson do you hope others will learn from your story?</p>

    <p>Odysseus: I want people to know that being smart and patient is just as important as being strong. And no matter how far you travel, there’s no place like home.</p>

    <p>Odysseus may be scarred by war and wanderings, but his eyes shine with the joy of a man who has finally stepped on familiar soil. Ithaca has its king back, and the story of his adventures will be told for generations.</p>
